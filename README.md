# UsesPermission2611
Easiest way to Ask for permissions in kotlin 
First create the variable x and store the result of the permission whether user have given it or not then according do any action 
In my case i have used Toast to show whether user has given permission or not 
then use two buttons and setOnclick listener and permissions you want when that button clicked
You are done !
